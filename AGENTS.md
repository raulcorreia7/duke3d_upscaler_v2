# AGENTS.md — Autonomous Development Contract

Authoritative, minimal contract for autonomous work in this repository. Keep code simple, clean, modular, and maintainable. Use proven patterns. Modes: Review → Plan → Build → Verify.

---

## Quick Start
```bash
make setup
make all
````

---

## Agent Modes

### REVIEW MODE

Create `docs/review.md` when code exists. Capture:

* Repo map: languages, toolchains, entry points, build/test/release commands.
* Dependency health: versions, cadence, licenses, advisories, upgrade candidates.
* Quality signals: lint/format status, test count/coverage (if available), CI duration/caches, flaky/slow tests.
* Hotspots: large/complex modules, duplication clusters, cycles, perf bottlenecks, portability issues.
* Risks/unknowns; immediate low-risk wins.

### PLAN MODE

Create `docs/plan.md`, `tasks/status.md`, and atomic tasks under `tasks/plan_<slug>/`.

* Tooling rule: prefer **agentic tools** for repository reconnaissance (symbol graph, usages, cross-repo search). Fall back to **system tools** when they’re faster for code search or structural inventory. Agentic examples: Sourcegraph Cody; Claude Code. System examples: ripgrep, fzf, universal-ctags. ([Sourcegraph Docs][1])
* Minimize questions; make labeled assumptions. Record risks, external dependencies, rollback paths.

### BUILD MODE

Deterministic changesets. Execute `DIRECTIVE` blocks in order. Small diffs. Update docs/tests in the same change. Append `.agents/action_log.md`.

* Prefer stable, community-reviewed libraries; verify install from upstream README. Integrate latest stable, then lock with the ecosystem’s lockfile (e.g., `uv` for Python projects). ([Sourcegraph][2])

### VERIFY MODE

Post-change smoke and performance checks. CI green; artifacts published. Update ADRs if architecture changed (use MADR template or equivalent). ([GitHub][3])

---

## Tooling Policy

**Agentic tools (primary in Plan/Build)**

* Sourcegraph Cody for code search across repos, symbol-aware context, large-scale edits. ([Sourcegraph Docs][1])
* Claude Code for project-wide assistance and autonomous edit workflows. ([Business Insider][4])

**System tools (adjacent/fallback)**

* ripgrep (`rg`) for fast, gitignore-aware search. ([GitHub][5])
* fzf for interactive filtering/selection. ([GitHub][6])
* universal-ctags for tags/symbol index. ([GitHub][7])

**Useful commands**

```bash
rg -n --no-messages 'TODO|FIXME|HACK'
rg -n --stats -S 'class |struct |interface |def ' -g '!**/vendor/**'
ctags -R -f .tags .
```

---

## Build & Containers

Expose canonical dev/build/test commands in `docs/plan.md`. For containerized builds, prefer multi-stage Dockerfiles to produce minimal runtime images; copy only the artifacts you need. ([Docker Documentation][8])

.state/                    # state.json, resumable markers (gitignored)
```

---

## Coding Standards

**Primary language**

* Enforce the ecosystem’s standard style and formatter. Keep linters fast. Type hints or interfaces on public APIs. Tests: unit for utilities; integration for workflows; snapshot/golden for binaries with tolerance windows.

**Shell**

* `set -euo pipefail`; trap errors; keep shell thin; prefer main language for logic.

**Make**

* Idempotent targets; explicit inputs/outputs; minimal `.PHONY`.

**Pipelines**

* Idempotent steps, pre/post validation, deterministic ordering, cross-platform behavior, resumable via `.state/state.json`.

**Docs**

* Machine-consumable first: commands, paths, contracts in `docs/plan.md` and `.agents/memory_bank.md`.

---

## Dependencies and Locking

Adopt → lock. Use the platform’s lockfile and reproducible install. Example for Python projects using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
uv pip sync requirements.lock
```
Ignore reading uv.lock

([Sourcegraph][2])

---

## Testing & CI

* Unit + integration on each change; property-based where useful; perf/memory budgets as tests where feasible.
* CI matrix across relevant OS/toolchains. Cache dependency/compile artifacts (e.g., ccache/sccache for C/C++). Publish build artifacts for review. ([ccache.dev][9])

---

## Documentation Discipline

Update `docs/review.md`, `docs/plan.md`, task files, and ADRs in the same change as code. Use MADR or a comparable ADR format for non-reversible choices. ([GitHub][3])

---

## Change Management

Small, single-concern changes. Conventional Commits; link task IDs; include repro steps, risks, and evidence. ([conventionalcommits.org][10])

---

## Security

No network writes without explicit directive. Validate external inputs. Enforce secret scanning in pre-commit/CI. Keep runtime containers minimal; prefer non-root execution. ([Docker Documentation][8])

---

## Memory Bank

`.agents/memory_bank.md` stores durable conventions:

* Code style and lint rules
* Project topology and entry points
* Canonical commands
* Domain invariants (security/perf budgets)
* Stack versions and lockfile policy

Keep high-signal, low-churn. Update when conventions change.

---

## Directives

Agents execute fenced `DIRECTIVE` blocks verbatim.

```DIRECTIVE
id: <ID>
goal: <single, testable outcome>
scope: <paths/**>
constraints:
  - <budgets, compatibility, security, exception-safety>
steps:
  - <ordered, deterministic actions>
verification:
  - <commands/checks for acceptance>
artifacts:
  - <docs/decisions/NNNN-*.md or other outputs>
logging:
  - append .agents/action_log.md with start/end + metrics
```
